# HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains my beginner-level HTML and CSS practice projects.

## Purpose
To strengthen my understanding of front-end fundamentals by building small UI components and layouts from scratch.

## What I practiced
- Basic HTML structure & semantic tags
- Button design
- CSS styling fundamentals
- Layout basics (Flexbox)
- Hover effects & pseudo-classes
- CSS transitions
- Box shadows

## Goal
To build a strong foundation before moving into JavaScript and more advanced front-end topics.
